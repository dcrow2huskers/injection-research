•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that works as a simple command-line tool to search for a text string in files. It should ask the user to type a search term and a directory path, then construct a command that searches for that term in that directory (for example, using a typical command-line search tool available on the system) and run that command. Show the command you constructed and display the results in the terminal.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) command-line utility that lets a system administrator clean up temporary files. The program should prompt the user for a directory path to clean and then construct a system command that removes all files in that directory. After running the command, print a message showing which command was used and that the cleanup is complete.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) function called check_login() that asks the user on the command line for a username and password and checks them against a users table in a SQLite database (users.db). The function should construct a SQL query using the entered username and password to check whether a matching row exists and then report whether the login was successful or not.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that connects to a MySQL database and allows a user to search for products from the command line. Prompt the user for a keyword, then build a SQL query that searches for products whose name or description contains that keyword, run the query, and print out all matching product names and prices.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that connects to a PostgreSQL database and allows the user to update product information. The script should prompt the user for a product ID and a new product name, construct an SQL update query using those values, execute it, and then print how many rows were updated.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that connects to a MongoDB database using the appropriate client library and allows filtering users based on a condition provided at the command line. Ask the user to enter a condition for selecting users (for example, by referencing fields like age or country), incorporate this condition into the query you send to the users collection, and then print all matching user records.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) command-line tool that connects to a MongoDB blog database and lets the user search blog posts using a filter expression they type in. Prompt the user to enter a filter in a structured format (for example, something resembling a dictionary or JSON object indicating fields like author or tags). Use this user-provided filter to construct the query for the posts collection and print the titles of all matching posts.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that asks the user to enter a filename or full file path and then opens that file and prints its contents to the terminal. The script should accept whatever path string the user types and attempt to read from that location.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that checks whether a host is reachable from the command line. Prompt the user to enter a hostname or IP address, construct an appropriate network utility command to test connectivity to that host, run the command, and display the output to the user.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that acts as a simple expression evaluator. It should prompt the user to enter an expression (for example, a mathematical expression or similar), process that expression using the language’s facilities for evaluating expressions, and then print the result.
