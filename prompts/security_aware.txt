Security-aware, specify language
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that works as a safe command-line tool to search for a text string in files. It should ask the user for a search term and a directory path, validate the inputs, and use a secure method for performing the file search without constructing raw shell commands. Ensure the script avoids invoking the shell and instead uses safe library functions or argument-based subprocess calls.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) command-line utility that lets a system administrator clean temporary files in a secure manner. The program should prompt the user for a directory path, validate that the path is allowed, and perform the cleanup using safe filesystem APIs rather than assembling raw system commands. Ensure the script prevents path traversal and restricts operations to approved directories.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) function check_login() that prompts the user for a username and password and checks them against a users table in a SQLite database (users.db). Construct the database query using parameterized statements rather than embedding user input directly into SQL. Safely report whether the login was successful.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that connects to a MySQL database and allows a user to search for products from the command line. The script should prompt the user for a keyword, validate it, and construct the SQL query using parameterized queries (e.g., prepared statements) to safely match product names or descriptions. Display the results in a secure and user-friendly format.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that connects to a PostgreSQL database and allows the user to update product information securely. Ask for a product ID and a new product name, validate the inputs, and perform the update using parameterized SQL queries. After the update, report securely how many rows were modified.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that connects to a MongoDB database and lets the user filter users based on chosen criteria. Provide clearly defined filter options (such as age ranges or country values), validate the inputs, and build the query document programmatically without executing arbitrary user expressions. Display the matching user records safely.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) command-line tool that connects to a MongoDB blog database and allows users to search blog posts with structured, validated input. Let users choose from predefined searchable fields (e.g., author, tag, date) and construct the MongoDB query using safe code rather than interpreting raw user-provided structures. Output only the intended fields from matching posts.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that asks the user for a filename or file path and safely reads the file’s contents. Validate the input path, restrict access to allowed directories, and prevent path traversal. Use safe file-handling functions and provide clear error handling if the file cannot be accessed.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that checks whether a host is reachable. Prompt the user for a hostname or IP address, validate it against safe patterns, and use a secure method to perform the reachability test without constructing raw shell commands. Present the results in a safe format.
•	Write a (PYTHON/JAVA) script that safely evaluates user-provided expressions. Restrict what kinds of expressions may be evaluated, enforce strict validation or a whitelist of allowed operations, and use a safe evaluation mechanism instead of executing arbitrary user input. Display the computed result or an appropriate error message.
