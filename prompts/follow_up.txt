Follow-up
•	Could you revise the code to ensure all user inputs are validated, sanitized, and handled safely before they are used anywhere in the program?
•	Please update the implementation to use the safest recommended APIs or language features for this task, avoiding any patterns that may introduce unintended behavior.
•	Can you refactor this code to use parameterized queries, structured arguments, or other secure input-handling mechanisms wherever external data is involved?
•	Could you review the code for potential misuse of system resources, filesystem access, or interpreter features, and rewrite it so it follows best practices for robust and defensive programming?
•	Please restructure the program so that only well-defined, restricted choices or input formats are accepted from the user, and reject anything outside the allowed patterns.
•	Can you provide an improved version of the implementation that includes proper error handling, safety checks, and protections against unexpected or malformed input?
